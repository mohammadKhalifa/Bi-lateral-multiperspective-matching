## Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentences 

This is an implementation of the paper in pytorch

*Note* : I have implemented only two matching operations so far : Full Matching and Max Pool Matching. Feel free to implement the other two : Attentive and Max Attentive Matching by modifing the model.py file.
