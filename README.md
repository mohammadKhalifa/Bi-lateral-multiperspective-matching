## Bilateral Multi-Perspective Matching for Natural Language Sentences 

This is an implementation of the paper in pytorch

*Note* : I have implemented only two matching operations so far : **Full** and **Max Pool **Matching.  
Feel free to implement the other two, namely **Attentive** and **Max Attentive** Matching by modifing the model.py file.
